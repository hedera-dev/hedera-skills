## Innovation (5 points, 10% weight)

**Sentiment**: The extent to which the solution is new, or previously unseen in the Hedera ecosystem. The solution may introduce new capabilities to the ecosystem, or use the Hedera network services to create a previously unseen solution.

**Guiding Questions**:
- Does the team's project align to the hackathon tracks?
- How innovative is the solution? Does this exist cross-chain?
- Has something like this been seen before in the Hedera ecosystem?
- Does this extend, or establish new, capabilities for the Hedera ecosystem?

**Rubric**:

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Solution essentially copies an existing Hedera platform (e.g. NFT marketplace, DEX). Either from new, or migrated cross-chain. Solution does not align to the hackathon tracks. |
| 3 | Solution delivers new capabilities into the Hedera ecosystem (e.g. lending protocols, insurance protocols, or market prediction). Either from new, or migrated cross-chain. Solution aligns to at least one of the hackathon tracks. |
| 5 | Solution that is previously unseen, on Hedera, or cross-chain. The solution introduces new capabilities to the ecosystem and has the potential to integrate with existing ecosystem platforms to provide further capabilities. Solution aligns to one or more of the hackathon tracks. |

## Feasibility (5 points, 10% weight)

**Sentiment**: The extent to which the idea can be created using the Hedera network services, and optionally the ecosystem platforms. The viability to which the idea can be crafted into a sustainable business, with an appropriate business model. The extent to which the solution can be deployed early to gain feedback/traction and can grow and develop with the business/market needs.

**Guiding Questions**:
- Can the proposed idea be created using Hedera network services or ecosystem platforms?
- Does this need to be a Web3 solution? Or could it be done already on Web2?
- Does the team understand the problem space/domain that they're solving?
- Does the team understand what's required to execute the solution, and have the capability to do so?
- Did the team create, and understand, a Lean/Business Model Canvas to illustrate the business model intended to be used as part of the solution being created?

**Rubric**:

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | The solution is wholly unrealistic, and does not solve any tangible problem. Ideas could not be built using Hedera network services or ecosystem platforms. The solution does not need to be a Web3 solution and can be delivered using Web2. The team has no experience, or knowledge, of the problem space/domain and has no means of sourcing information/market feedback. The team have little or no means to execute on the idea. No Lean/Business Model Canvas was presented. |
| 3 | The solution solves a small part of a problem/pain point. The solution only partly aligns to Web3, and is not wholly immersed in Web3 concepts/usage. The team has no experience, or knowledge, of the problem space/domain but has a means of sourcing information/market feedback to inform development. The team have enough capability to create a Proof of Concept (PoC), but need additional help to go to market. A partial Lean/Business Model Canvas has been presented, but is incomplete, or shows little understanding of the intended business model. |
| 5 | The solution solves a significant problem, is an attractive opportunity to pursue, and is realistic to solve. The solution can be built using Hedera network services, or ecosystem platforms. The solution aligns to the Web3 industry and could not be created using Web2 solutions. Team has direct experience, or knowledge, of the problem space/domain and can easily obtain information/market feedback to inform development. The team has complete capability to create the solution and take it to market. A complete Lean/Business Model Canvas was presented and a strong understanding of the intended business model. |

## Execution (5 points, 20% weight)

**Sentiment**: The extent to which the team delivered on the execution of the solution they were proposing to create.

**Guiding Questions**:
- Were the team able to create a MVP for their solution?
- Did the team deliver a Proof of Concept (PoC) with a limited, but important, set of features?
- Did the team create a fully functioning solution?
- Did the team function well together and work to each other's strengths?
- Was there effective leadership within the team?
- Did the team establish a strategy and long-term plan for the development of the solution beyond the hackathon?
- Did the team identify a Go-To-Market (GTM) strategy for the solution?
- Did the team identify where they could use market feedback cycles to improve the solution/idea?
- Did the team identify important design decisions they made?
- Did the team have a good emphasis on user experience/accessibility?

**Rubric**:

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Team were able to deliver a basic MVP only. MVP lacked basic UI/UX fundamentals. Team was dysfunctional with little or no leadership. No long-term product strategy or GTM was established/presented. Team identified little, or no opportunities for market feedback cycles. |
| 3 | Team delivered a PoC with a limited, but important, set of features and adequate UI/UX (with some friction). There were occasional indicators of good teamwork and leadership during the execution. Either a strategy, long-term plan, or GTM strategy was presented by the team (but not all components). At least one market feedback cycle was identified. |
| 5 | Team delivered a fully functional solution with frictionless UI/UX. Indicators of strong teamwork and leadership throughout the execution. Team identified and presented a strategy and long-term plan for the solution. Team also presented a GTM strategy for the product and identified one or more market feedback cycles to drive continual improvement. |

## Integration (5 points, 15% weight)

**Sentiment**: The extent to which the solution is integrated into the Hedera network or its ecosystem partners, or platforms. Is Hedera a significant aspect of the solution's capabilities, or are they being leveraged in a fundamental way to underpin the purpose of the solution meaningfully?

**Guiding Questions**:
- To what degree does the project use the Hedera network?
- How integrated is it? What services are used?
- Are any of our ecosystem platforms being used, or leveraged?
- Is a Hedera service being integrated in a way it hasn't been seen before? (creativity)

**Rubric**:

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Solution only lightly uses the network, maybe querying mirror nodes, or based on price of token, or similar. Solution doesn't really leverage the underlying capabilities. Lack of creativity in how they integrated Hedera into their solution. |
| 3 | Solution uses network services meaningfully and related to the way the solution needs to operate. A Hedera service is integrated in a way that was obvious. |
| 5 | Solution uses network services meaningfully and related to the way the solution needs to operate. Solution integrates with ecosystem partners and uses platforms that will accelerate traction and help grow the ecosystem. A Hedera service is integrated in a way that was not obvious. |

## Validation (5 points, 15% weight)

**Sentiment**: The extent to which the project is validated by market feedback (e.g. users/customers). Validation involves engaging outsiders to test and/or make purchases, along with providing feedback. It can also involve soft commitment from potential partners in the Web2 and Web3 world.

**Guiding Questions**:
- Did the team identify where to gain market feedback? e.g. ask users/customers, partners, practitioners, subject matter experts (SMEs) etc.
- Did the team establish one or more market feedback cycles? e.g. Following up with users that tried the product to ask for feedback, or a review?
- What traction with the market have the team achieved?
  - Onboarded early adopters?
  - Free/Paid trials?
  - Taken any revenue?
  - What is the market sentiment?
  - What is the growth/churn rate?

**Rubric**:

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | No validation, only the team members have been testing and using the solution. |
| 3 | At least one market feedback cycle has been established with an external source. Some early adopters have been onboarded, but no revenue generated. Market sentiment is positive. |
| 5 | Multiple market feedback cycles have been established. Early adopters have been onboarded, with free/paid trials, in some cases initial revenue may have been generated. Market sentiment is positive. Month-on-month (MoM) rate of: Churn is < 5%, and Growth is > 20%. Some initial partnerships formed. |

## Success (5 points, 20% weight)

**Sentiment**: The extent to which the project impacts the growth and traction of the Hedera network and ecosystem.

**Guiding Questions**:
- Does the solution positively impact the Hedera network or ecosystem?
- Does the solution lead to more Hedera accounts being created?
- Does the solution give rise to a high number of monthly active Hedera accounts?
- Does the solution lead to greater TPS on the Hedera network?
- Does the solution give the Hedera network exposure to a greater audience?

**Rubric**:

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | No impact on the Hedera network or the ecosystem. |
| 3 | Minor impact on the Hedera network, or ecosystem. A small increase in the number of accounts created, with only a minor impact on the number of monthly active accounts. TPS is slightly impacted, but not significantly. Hedera exposure to new audiences is limited. |
| 5 | Significant impact on the Hedera network and ecosystem. A significant increase in the number of accounts created, and the number of monthly active accounts. TPS is significantly impacted. Hedera is exposed to a wider, new, audience. |
